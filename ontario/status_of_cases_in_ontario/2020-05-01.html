<h2 id="section-0">Status of cases in Ontario</h2>

<p>Ontario is now providing a more detailed summary of COVID-19 cases in the province that will be updated each day&#xA0;<strong>at 10:30 a.m.</strong></p>

<p>This <a href="https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-report-en-2020-05-01.pdf">daily epidemiologic summary</a> replaces the information on the status of COVID-19 cases that was previously provided twice daily on this page. The new summary provides more provincial and regional data on confirmed cases, demographics and trends of cases since the outbreak began including geography, exposure and severity.&#xA0;</p>

<p>The daily summary is based on&#xA0;data reported by the 32&#xA0;public health units across Ontario and recorded in the province&#x2019;s integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). iPHIS is the Ministry of Health&#x2019;s disease reporting system where data is regularly updated. Data for each day&#x2019;s summary will be pulled from iPHIS&#xA0;<strong>at 4:00 p.m.</strong>&#xA0;the previous day and from the Toronto Public Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES) and Ottawa Public Health COVID-19 Ottawa Database (COD) as of <strong>2:00 p.m.</strong> the previous day.</p>

<p>Ontario is working with its partners in the health care system implementing a robust plan to monitor for, detect and, if needed, isolate any cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The Ministry of Health is taking several steps to ensure the health and safety of Ontarians. This includes:</p>

<ul><li>enacting a <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e09#BK5">declaration of emergency</a> to help stop the spread and keep people safe</li>
	<li>monitoring hospitals for potential cases of the virus in individuals with travel history to areas under a <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices">travel health advisory</a> for COVID-19</li>
	<li>adding the 2019 novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under Ontario&apos;s public health legislation, enabling local public health units to quickly and effectively take all necessary measures to investigate, complete lab tests and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection</li>
	<li>ongoing planning with federal and provincial/territorial partners and readiness to coordinate with other provinces/territories</li>
	<li>through the work of the Command Table,&#xA0;refining and finalizing plans for the implementation of enhanced measures to ensure the province continues to be&#xA0;prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any scenario, including:
	<ul><li><a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-self-assessment">enhanced access to screening</a></li>
		<li>expanding lab-testing capacity</li>
		<li>implementing new initiatives to keep the public and frontline workers safe</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><h2 id="section-3">Laboratory testing</h2>

<p>Testing is being conducted at many laboratories across the province, in coordination with the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>
