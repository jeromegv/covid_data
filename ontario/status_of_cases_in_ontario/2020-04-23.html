<h2 id="section-0">Status of cases in Ontario</h2>

<p>Ontario is now providing a more detailed summary of COVID-19 cases in the province that will be updated each day&#xA0;<strong>at 10:30 a.m.</strong></p>

<p>This <a href="https://files.ontario.ca/moh-covid-19-report-en-2020-04-23.pdf">daily epidemiologic summary</a> replaces the information on the status of COVID-19 cases that was previously provided twice daily on this page. The new summary provides more provincial and regional data on confirmed cases, demographics and trends of cases since the outbreak began including geography, exposure and severity.&#xA0;</p>

<p>The daily summary is based on&#xA0;data reported by the 33&#xA0;public health units across Ontario and recorded in the province&#x2019;s integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). iPHIS is the Ministry of Health&#x2019;s disease reporting system where data is regularly updated. Data for each day&#x2019;s summary will be pulled from iPHIS&#xA0;<strong>at 4:00 p.m.</strong>&#xA0;the previous day and from the Toronto Public Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES) as of <strong>2:00 p.m.</strong> the previous day.</p>

<p>Data Source:</p>

<ul><li>The data for this report were based on information extracted from the Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH) integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) database, as of April 22, 2020 at 4 p.m. and data extracted from the Toronto Public Health (Coronavirus Rapid Entry System) CORES, as of April 22, 2020 at 2 p.m.&#xA0;</li>
	<li>iPHIS and CORES are dynamic disease reporting systems, which allows ongoing updates to data previously entered. As a result, data extracted from iPHIS and CORES represent a snapshot at the time of extraction and may differ from previous or subsequent reports.</li>
</ul><h2 id="section-1">Declaration of emergency</h2>

<p>The province has enacted a <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e09#BK5">declaration of emergency</a> to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and protect the public.</p>

<p>As a result, the following establishments are required to close immediately:</p>

<ul><li>all bars and restaurants, except to the extent that such facilities provide takeout and food delivery</li>
	<li>all facilities providing indoor recreational programs</li>
	<li>all public libraries</li>
	<li>all private schools</li>
	<li>all licensed child care centres</li>
	<li>all movie cinemas</li>
	<li>all theatres, including those offering live performances of music, dance and other art forms</li>
	<li>all concert venues</li>
	<li>communal or shared, public or private, outdoor recreational amenities including but not limited to:
	<ul><li>playgrounds</li>
		<li>sports fields</li>
		<li>basketball and tennis courts</li>
		<li>off-leash dog parks</li>
		<li>benches</li>
		<li>skateboard and BMX parks</li>
		<li>picnic areas</li>
		<li>outdoor community gardens</li>
		<li>park shelters</li>
		<li>outdoor exercise equipment</li>
		<li>condo parks and gardens</li>
		<li>other outdoor recreational amenities</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>Additionally, all organized public events of over 5&#xA0;people are prohibited, including parades, events including weddings, social gatherings and communal services within places of worship.</p>

<p>This order would not apply to private households with five people or more. It would also not apply to &#xA0;operating child care centres supporting frontline health care workers and first responders&#xA0;provided the number of persons at each centre does not exceed 50 people. Funerals would be permitted to proceed with up to 10 people at one time.&#xA0;</p>

<p>These orders will remain in place until April 13, 2020, when the province will reassess for an extension or end the closures.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">Coronaviruses</h2>

<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more serious respiratory infections like bronchitis, pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</p>

<p>Coronaviruses are spread mainly from person to person through close contact, for example, in a household, workplace or health care centre.</p>

<p>Some human coronaviruses spread easily between people, while others do not.</p>

<p>Your risk of severe disease may be higher if you have a weakened immune system. This may be the case for:</p>

<ul><li>older people</li>
	<li>people with chronic disease (for example,&#xA0;diabetes, cancer, heart, renal&#xA0;or chronic lung disease)</li>
</ul><div>
<h2 id="section-3">The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>
</div>

<p>The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) causes a respiratory infection that originated in Wuhan, China.</p>

<p>The first presumptive case of this infection in Ontario was identified on January 25, 2020.</p>

<h2 id="section-4"><a id="areas" name="areas"></a>Current affected areas</h2>

<p>The number of countries now reporting cases of COVID-19 has expanded and continues to change on a daily basis. The World Health Organization (WHO) is maintaining lists of affected areas/countries in their daily <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">Situation Report</a>, which can be found on the WHO website.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="section-5">Returning from travel</h2>
</div>

<p>Anyone who has travelled outside of Canada should:</p>

<ul><li><a href="#selfisolate">self-isolate</a> for 14 days when they return. People who are self-isolating should not go to work</li>
	<li>monitor themselves for symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus for 14 days after returning to Canada</li>
	<li>contact their primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario at&#xA0;<onesite-phone>1-866-797-0000</onesite-phone> if they experience symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus</li>
</ul><p>In addition:</p>

<ul><li>Workers who have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they do not have symptoms. However, they should <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/factsheet-covid-19-self-monitor.pdf?la=en">self-monitor</a> for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.</li>
	<li>Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also <a href="#selfisolate">self-isolate</a> for a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children&apos;s symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at home and avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks.</li>
</ul><p>Learn about <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices">travel advisories</a> related to the 2019 novel coronavirus.</p>

<h2 id="section-6">Laboratory testing</h2>

<p>Testing is being conducted at many laboratories across the province, in coordination with the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>

<h2 id="section-7">How Ontario is responding</h2>

<p>Ontario is working with its partners in the health care system implementing a robust plan to monitor for, detect and, if needed, isolate any cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The Ministry of Health is taking several steps to ensure the health and safety of Ontarians. This includes:</p>

<ul><li>monitoring hospitals for potential cases of the virus in individuals with travel history to areas under a <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices">travel health advisory</a> for COVID-19</li>
	<li>adding the 2019 novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under Ontario&apos;s public health legislation, enabling local public health units to quickly and effectively take all necessary measures to investigate, complete lab tests and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection</li>
	<li>ongoing planning with federal and provincial/territorial partners and readiness to coordinate with other provinces/territories</li>
	<li>through the work of the Command Table,&#xA0;refining and finalizing plans for the implementation of enhanced measures to ensure the province continues to be&#xA0;prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any scenario, including: <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-self-assessment">enhanced access to screening</a>; expanding lab-testing capacity; and implementing new initiatives to keep the public and frontline workers safe</li>
</ul><h2 id="section-8">Symptoms and treatment</h2>

<p>Symptoms range from mild &#x2013; like the flu and other common respiratory infections &#x2013; to severe. The most common symptoms include:</p>

<ul><li>fever</li>
	<li>cough</li>
	<li>difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>muscle aches</li>
	<li>fatigue</li>
	<li>headache</li>
	<li>sore throat</li>
	<li>runny nose</li>
</ul><p>Complications from the 2019 novel coronavirus can include serious conditions, like pneumonia or kidney failure, and in some cases, death.</p>

<p>There are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, and there is no vaccine that protects against coronaviruses. Most people with common human coronavirus illnesses will recover on their own.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul><li>drink plenty of fluids</li>
	<li>get rest and sleep as much as possible</li>
	<li>try a humidifier or a hot shower to help with a sore throat or cough</li>
</ul><h3>If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19</h3>

<ul><li>Anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) should return home and&#xA0;<a href="#selfisolate">self-isolate</a>&#xA0;immediately.</li>
	<li>People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either by calling their primary care provider&apos;s office or Telehealth Ontario <onesite-phone>1-866-797-0000</onesite-phone>. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario will direct you to in-person care options.</li>
</ul><p>If you need immediate medical attention you should call 911 and mention your travel history and symptoms.</p>

<h2 id="section-9">How to protect yourself</h2>

<p>Coronaviruses are spread mainly from person to person through close contact, for example, in a household, workplace or health care centre.</p>

<p>There is no vaccine available to protect against the 2019 novel coronavirus, but there are actions you can take to help prevent the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses.</p>

<h3>Everyday actions</h3>

<p>Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to the virus and protect your health:</p>

<ul><li>wash your hands often with soap and water&#xA0;or alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
	<li>sneeze and cough into your sleeve</li>
	<li>avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth</li>
	<li>avoid contact with people who are sick</li>
	<li>stay home if you are sick</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://files.ontario.ca/moh-coronavirus-pec-poster-en-2020-03-09.pdf">Poster: What you need to know to help you and your family stay healthy</a></p>

<h3><a id="social-distancing"></a></h3>

<h3 id="physical-distancing">Physical distancing</h3>

<p>Everyone in Ontario should be practicing physical distancing to reduce their exposure to other people.</p>

<p>Everyone in Ontario should do their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within two (2) meters of another person.</p>

<p>If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, you should begin to <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/factsheet-covid-19-self-monitor.pdf?la=en">self-monitor</a> for a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to physical distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (for example, sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services.</p>

<h2 id="section-10"><a id="selfisolate" name="selfisolate"></a>How to self-isolate</h2>

<p>Self-isolating means staying at home and avoiding contact with other people to help prevent the spread of disease to others in your home and your community.</p>

<p>All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolate for a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons. Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.</p>

<div class="callout">
